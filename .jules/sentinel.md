**Vulnerability:** User-controlled data (filenames, codecs) containing control characters or excessive length can be written to EXIF tags, potentially causing metadata corruption or parser issues.
**Learning:** `ExifInterface` does not automatically sanitize or truncate strings. Filenames from `VideoMetadata` are user-controlled and can contain garbage.
**Prevention:** Sanitize all string inputs to EXIF tags by removing control characters (including newlines) and enforcing a reasonable length limit before writing.
